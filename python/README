GetPot - Python:
--------------

This is the Python port of the popular GetPot library for 
command line and input file parsing. Currently only
a C++ documentation is available. The files in the 
'examples' directory should be enough, though, to be 
able to use this library. It is fairly easy to use.

Further information is available at:

             http://getpot.sourceforge.net

Installation:
-------------

In order to install GetPot, simply copy the file 'GetPot.py'
or 'GetPot.pyc' (after you compiled it) somewhere where
your python interpreter can find it.

The 'file emacs-getpot-mode.el' contains some lines of
emacs-lisp code. If you append these lines to your .emacs
file, it will highlight your 'getpot' - input files.

Bug reports, Feature requests:
------------------------------

Please, notify me in case there are any bugs or you think
that there should be more features in the library.

Enjoy !
